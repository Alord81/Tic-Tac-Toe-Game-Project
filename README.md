# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
            Hi Everyone :-)!
            
            My name is Abdullrahman,
            and this is my project for the Tic Tac Toe (or XO Game).
            It took me about 7 hours to completeâ€”most of which was spent on the basic and imperfect design. But hey!
            This is just a warm-up and a simple exercise in preparation for the big projects ahead.

            Technologies Used:
             * C#.Net (I'm still learning it as of now)
